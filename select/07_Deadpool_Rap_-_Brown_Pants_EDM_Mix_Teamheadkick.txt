They call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast
Came to merc the bad guys, and get some ass
Got blades for days, got guns galore
Got combo moves, evades and more
With bear traps and hand grenades
Pull the pistol like a maniac right in your face
Poppin off caps, leave a trail of guts
Sittin' on my chair, scratchin' my nuts

Don't stop when I shoot, full-auto is on
Your ass is grass, and I'm mowin' the lawn
Hot lead to the head, and I won't stop
What yo crew gonna do, when I hack and chop
But all these bitches are primadonas
I stuff my face with Chimichangas
Tacos and beers, always keepin' it loose
Hang on for a minute while I'm droppin' a deuce
(Deadpool)
Sexy motherfucka (Deadpool)
(Deadpool)
Captain Deadpool (Nah, just Deadpool)
Merc with a mouth, I can't die
One foot in the grave
But I'm still alive
Try to kill me, I'll just revive
Then I'll put another bullet right between your eyes
I'm dangerous, feeling reckless
Squeeze your neck like I was a necklace
Jump clip and leave 'em headless
I like my guns all big like Texas
Hey goons, thugs and bosses
Guess what? I brought Colossus!
Time's up, better count your losses
Kickin' that ass, as my girlfriend watches
Run away, you know that I'll chase
Every bad guy, put them right in their place
Revenge, im gonna give you a taste
I'm sexy as hell, but I cover my face
I'm bout to take you all to school with guns and knives
(Deadpool)
Tellin' jokes and breakin' the rules, I came for the tacos
(Deadpool)
Playin' with the ladies and my family jewels to bust a nut
(Deadpool)
'Bout to throw down with all these fools so come and get some
Bring the noise, I'll bring the pain
Ha! Kickin' ass and taking names
Payback time, I'm not playing games
These superpowers, are feeling strange
I move like a freakin' ninja
Hand to hand, you know I'll lead ya
Got two swords now I'll avenge ya
I don't care if I offend ya
Listen up, I got something to say
That's right, I run my mouth all day
Step up, take a blood bath
Now you're trying to run, and it's making me laugh
Ha ha ha
Where ya gonna go to?
Tryin' to hide, but you know that I'll find you
Tippy toe, sneakin' up behind you
I'm Deadpool, do I have to remind you?
Regenerate, because it's cool
Wanna fall off a ledge (Deadpool)
The crazy ass guards, all lookin' to duel
So click click BOOM! (Deadpool)
I don't believe in the Golden Rule
I came to get laid (Deadpool)
Note to the ladies: I'm not a tool, I'm a sexy motherfucka
(Sexy motherfucka)
(Deadpool)
