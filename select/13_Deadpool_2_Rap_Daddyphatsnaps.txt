Wade Wilson coming in the building grab
Earmuffs for your children killing like a villain
Gosh thats a lot of blood spilling better
Hope that you run quick when i start killing

Its over hit you with katanas to your legs
Drop off then you arms fall all in the same spot
Im a killer i just found a platform
Already lost my mind can i have yours?

Im a fan of crackwhores WAIT i mean
Captors thats an easy mistake cause i smack more
People in a day that i cant remember all of em
But i always separate the two when i slaughter them

I dont even know what im rapping about mr
Reynolds with the first track merc with a mouth
And i need a hype men would it hurt you to shout
Heres a motivation bullet have you blurting it out see?

Whats that so bad a little motivation keep
This up and you may make it out the basement
After Wolverine Origins with origins they were
Hatin then i got my own flick onwed the r rating

Killed it in the cinemas but honestly degrading
Being stuck with the rejects cuz the other ones were taken
Should of won an oscar teaming with the
Colossus Colossus i saw the first script and i lost it

Anyway im climbing back through the fourth
Wall its like ten deadpool songs i searched all
And this is the best one full of mad danger
Subtle like the black guy playing black ranger

Now i gotta deal with cox i mean cable
Imma call you cox cause danmit he's anal

Now im rocking with the Xforce escorts with the red dot infrared ports
Got two words and they spell t-crews
Do i need to say more man we cant lose

I dont need to be in the infinity war every
Time i see a trailer man im literally bored
Where the tacos have you even been to the to the
Store have you ever shot a bullet through a honda accord

Through the door point blank is the violence and gore
Just a little bit much for your audience swarms WHOOPS
I forgot you handle chick flicks trying
To get rich land the pitch with big wigs
What a dipstick sending nods and deck pics
To your grandma eating fries and fish sticks

Weapon x project made me a small tank
Overtake your whole team with a small shank
Put em in a line you can all get spanked
By the red dank and by that i mean TAINT

Out there on another planet space cadet
Been around since you madafaks played cassettes
Ive been chopped in little bits even lost a
Head had my insides spread and i sill aint dead

So try me grimy and highly
Unsightly psyche slightly broke but hey im me
So i better see you there for the
Sequel get a dose of Wade Wilson's full lethal
